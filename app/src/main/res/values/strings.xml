    <string name="nasaImageDesc">The brightly glowing plumes seen in this image are reminiscent of an underwater scene,
        with turquoise-tinted currents and nebulous strands reaching out into the surroundings.

However, this is no ocean. This image actually shows part of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC),
        a small nearby galaxy that orbits our galaxy, the Milky Way, and appears as a blurred blob in our skies.
        The NASA/European Space Agency (ESA) Hubble Space Telescope has peeked many times into this galaxy,
        In addition to extending the ICESat record, IceBridge also sets the stage for ICESat-2, which is scheduled for launch in 2017.
